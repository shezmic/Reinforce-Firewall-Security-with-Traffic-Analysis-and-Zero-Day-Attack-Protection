## Read Me
This Python script enhances firewall security by analyzing incoming traffic and detecting It captures packets, extracts their information, and filters them based on predefined rules. The script should be to enhance its security capabilities.

## Features
- Capture and analyze Ethernet frames and IP packets
- Extract information such as source and destination IPs, ports, and flags
- Filter traffic based on predefined rules (e.g., block specific ports or IPs)
- Extendable to detect zero-day attacks (e.g., unusual traffic patterns, high traffic volume)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- A Linux-based system with packet capturing capabilities (e.g., root access)

## Usage
1. Add the script to your firewall system.
2. Adjust the filtering rules in the `filter_traffic` function as needed.
3. Run the script with root privileges to capture and analyze incoming traffic.
4. Implement custom zero-day detection logic in the `filter_traffic` function if needed.

## Disclaimer
